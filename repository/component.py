# This file defines a generic object interface mechanism and
# a way to determine which components implements a given interface.
#
# For example, the following defines the Music class as implementing the
# listenable interface.
#
# class Listenable(Interface):
#     pass
#
# class Music(Component):
#    implements(Listenable)
#
# Several class can implements a such interface, and it is possible to
# discover which class implements it with implementations():
#
# list_of_classes = implementations(Listenable)
#
# This mechanism support inheritance of interfaces: a class implementing a given
# interface is also considered to implement all the ascendants of this interface.
#
# However, inheritance is not supported for components. The descendants of a class
# implementing a given interface are not automatically considered to implement this
# interface too.
